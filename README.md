MyApp.js
=========

MyApp.js is an example front-end application using an object-oriented MVC architecture with an observable pattern. Both the framework and example application are written in JavaScript adhering to ECMAScript 5. The MVC sub-system utilizes prototype chaining for fast inheritance.

* To give this thing a test run, just open the `MyApp.html` page in a browser.
* To view the docs, just open `jsdoc/index.html` in a browser.

The sub-system is complete, I think. We'll release in beta.

The architecture is still in design, while the framework reflects only what is designed.
